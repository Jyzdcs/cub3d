- **Status**: [Planning/In Progress/Completed]

## Milestone 1: TDD Environment Setup

### Week 1

- [ ] **TDD Environment Setup**

  - [ ] Install development tools (gcc, make, valgrind, gdb)
  - [ ] Set up testing framework (Unity, CUnit, or custom)
  - [ ] Configure test automation (Makefile targets)
  - [ ] Set up continuous integration (if applicable)
  - [ ] Create TDD coding standards document

- [ ] **Project Architecture Planning**

  - [ ] Define main data structures
  - [ ] Plan module organization (testable units)
  - [ ] Design header files structure
  - [ ] Create basic project skeleton with test structure

## Milestone 2: TDD Core Development

> **ðŸ’¡ Explanation of the difference:**
>
> - **Red-Green-Refactor Cycles** = The **methodology** of TDD (how to do it)
> - **Core Functionality** = The **specific features** of your project (what to do)

### Week 2-3

- [ ] **Red-Green-Refactor Cycles (TDD Methodology)**

  - [ ] **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for main functions
  - [ ] **Green Phase**: Write minimal code to pass tests
  - [ ] **Refactor Phase**: Improve code while keeping tests green
  - [ ] Repeat cycle for each feature

- [ ] **Core Functionality (Main Features)**

  - [ ] **Concrete example**: File parsing function
    - [ ] Test: "should parse a valid .cub file"
    - [ ] Test: "should reject an invalid .cub file"
    - [ ] Implementation of parsing function
  - [ ] **Concrete example**: Map validation function
    - [ ] Test: "should validate a map with closed walls"
    - [ ] Test: "should reject a map with open walls"
    - [ ] Implementation of validation function
  - [ ] Maintain 100% test coverage

### Week 4-5

- [ ] **Advanced Features (TDD Approach)**

  - [ ] Write tests for complex algorithms
  - [ ] Implement algorithms to pass tests
  - [ ] Write tests for error handling
  - [ ] Implement error handling
  - [ ] Write tests for memory management
  - [ ] Implement memory management

## Milestone 3: TDD Quality Assurance

### Week 6-7

- [ ] **Test Suite Maintenance**

  - [ ] Review and refactor test cases
  - [ ] Add edge case tests
  - [ ] Validate test coverage (aim for 100%)
  - [ ] Performance test implementation

- [ ] **Integration Testing (TDD Style)**

  - [ ] Write integration tests first
  - [ ] Implement integration features
  - [ ] End-to-end test scenarios
  - [ ] System behavior validation

## Milestone 4: TDD Documentation & Polish

### Week 8-9

- [ ] **Living Documentation**

  - [ ] Write comprehensive README
  - [ ] Document all functions (with test examples)
  - [ ] Create user manual with test scenarios
  - [ ] Add code comments (test-driven)

- [ ] **Code Quality (TDD Style)**

  - [ ] Refactor based on test feedback
  - [ ] Follow TDD coding standards
  - [ ] Optimize performance (with performance tests)
  - [ ] Final cleanup (all tests still pass)

## TDD Key Milestones

- [ ] **Milestone 1**: TDD environment setup complete
- [ ] **Milestone 2**: First Red-Green-Refactor cycle complete
- [ ] **Milestone 3**: Core functionality with 100% test coverage
- [ ] **Milestone 4**: All features implemented with TDD
- [ ] **Milestone 5**: Integration tests complete

## TDD Risk Management

### Potential TDD Risks

- [ ] **TDD-Specific Risks**

  - [ ] Test maintenance overhead
  - [ ] Over-testing vs under-testing
  - [ ] Test brittleness
  - [ ] Learning curve for TDD

- [ ] **Technical Risks**

  - [ ] Complex algorithm testing
  - [ ] Memory management testing
  - [ ] Performance testing in TDD
  - [ ] Platform compatibility testing

### TDD Mitigation Strategies

- [ ] Start with simple tests
- [ ] Regular test refactoring
- [ ] Pair programming for TDD
- [ ] Test-driven code reviews
- [ ] Continuous integration with tests

## TDD Resources & Tools

### Testing Framework

- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Unity, CUnit, or custom framework
- [ ] **Mocking**: Custom mocks or CMock
- [ ] **Test Runner**: Custom or framework-specific
- [ ] **Coverage**: gcov, lcov
- [ ] **Memory Testing**: Valgrind integration

### Development Tools

- [ ] Compiler: GCC
- [ ] Build system: Make (with test targets)
- [ ] Debugger: GDB
- [ ] Memory checker: Valgrind
- [ ] Profiler: [Tool name]

### TDD Documentation Tools

- [ ] Markdown for documentation
- [ ] Test examples in documentation
- [ ] Git for version control
- [ ] [Additional tools]

## TDD Success Criteria

- [ ] All requirements met (with tests)
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Documentation includes test examples
- [ ] Performance targets achieved (with performance tests)
- [ ] Memory leaks eliminated (with memory tests)
- [ ] Code follows TDD standards
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor cycle maintained

## TDD Best Practices

- [ ] **Test First**: Always write tests before implementation
- [ ] **Small Steps**: Make small, incremental changes
- [ ] **Fast Feedback**: Keep test execution fast
- [ ] **Clear Tests**: Write readable, maintainable tests
- [ ] **Refactor Regularly**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
- [ ] **Test Edge Cases**: Cover boundary conditions
- [ ] **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units under test
